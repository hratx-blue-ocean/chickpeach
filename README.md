# chickpeach

Chickpeach is your one stop meal planning, recipe discovery and grocery-management app. The app is able to be configured to several dietary restrictions and preferences, and can also be scaled to accommodate meal-planning for more than one person. Don't like bananas? They won't show up anywhere in your menu, or in search results. Once you've selected the recipes you'd like to cook in a week, the app will auto generate a shopping list. Chickpeach is fully responsive and can be taken on the go, or browsed as a rich desktop experience.
